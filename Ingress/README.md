ALB Ingress Controller
=======================

In the private subnet for the cluster, review the tags.  For the public subnet(s) add the tags.  To know the tag name, look a the private subnet with "shared" value - 
the key                                 Value 
kubernetes.io/cluster/eks-demo          shared
kubernetes.io/role/elb                  1



Create an IAM role for ALB Ingress Controller, will use a custom policy
Service: EC2
    eks-alb-role

Copy and paste from alb_ingress_role_policy.json

Build trust relationship, copy the node role ARN in the ALB role

    ,"AWS": "nodeRole ARN"

In the NodeRole, (in the kube2iam lab) we have already provided AssumeRole in the prior steps.  To confirm, go the role, click Trust Relationships, and click Edit Trust Relationships



Copy the eks-alb-role ARN and add annotation in the deployment, alb-ingress-controller.yaml, to refer eks-alb-role ARN 

metadata:

   annotations:
     iam.amazonaws.com/role: eks-alb-role-ARN

    --aws-region=us-west-2

    kcf rbac-role.yaml

    kcf alb-ingress-controller.yaml

When the controller gets deployed, the LB is not created, but gets created when the ingress is created. As next step....

The alb-ingress-controller gets created in the kube-system namespace, hence annotate this namespace

In the namespace, kube-system, annotate eks-alb-role ARN 

   annotations:
     iam.amazonaws.com/allowed-roles: |
       ["eks-alb-role ARN"]


=====R53 External DNS configuration=======

Create a namespace - external-dns (in our case, we edited the file and added to external-dns.yaml)
Ingress creates LB - Route53 - points to this LB.  This section will discuss automatic configuration of R53-->LB-->ALB IC

Create an IAM role - eks-external-dns-role (route53 access)

Node - Trust relationship

eks-external-dns-role trusts node role

In the external-dns.yaml file

Annotate namespace - external-dns with the above role
  annotations:
     iam.amazonaws.com/allowed-roles: |
       ["eks-external-dns-role ARN"]

Update --domain-filter=sadaiyer.com

Under Ingress --> files are 
    external-dns.yaml

=====ALB Ingress resource========

FOR ALB, service can be NodePort or LoadBalancer

    kcf deployment/alb_service.yaml

    kgs

Now, deploy alb-ingress, check the annotations before you deploy

    kcf deployments/alb_ingress.yaml

In the EKS cluster, edit the additional SG to add the LB security group.  This is a nuisance, so create a security group - alb-ingress-sg with inbound rules http and https (0.0.0.0/0), and now associate the new SG with the EKS cluster additional SG (all traffic)

I created for me - sg-0471f895eb8dd0222, and now add in the "additional security group" for the EKS cluster a rule to allow access from "sg-0471f895eb8dd0222"

With this new SG created, now associate via annotation in the ALB ingress (alb_ingress.yaml)  There are other annotations that can be configured as well.

    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/security-groups: <sgname>

    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listebn-ports: '[{HTTPS:443}, {HTTP:80}]'

In R53, a new record will be created for ELB, how is this configured is next
